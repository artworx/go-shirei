# UDP drive commands

The windowed app can listen on a loopback UDP port and apply **one command
per datagram**. This file is that command list.

How to stamp names on containers and write `go test` clients is
[drive-tutorial.md](drive-tutorial.md). The Go helper is `shirei/drive`.

## Wire

Call `app.SetupDrive()` after `SetupWindow` and before `Run`. It reads
`SHIREI_DRIVE_PORT` (set by `drive.Start`, or by a human:
`SHIREI_DRIVE_PORT=4372 go run .`) and, if the value is a positive
port, binds a loopback listener. No port is a no-op. It also calls
`SetupQuiet` unless `SHIREI_DRIVE_FOREGROUND` is on, so `go test` does
not steal the editor.

`AcceptInputCommands(port)` is the lower layer: bind this port, no
quiet window, no env. Use it when you want to pick the port or the
conditions yourself. Non-loopback senders are dropped. The app does
not listen unless something calls one of these.

Each datagram is one UTF-8 line. The reply fits in **1024 bytes** (the
`udplib` buffer). A `query` with many hits includes only whole records
that fit; it never sends a torn last record. Inject commands reply an
empty datagram (delivery is the success flag). Unknown commands and
bad arguments reply `error: …`.

The handler runs under the frame lock and does **not** wait for another
produce. Pointer and key commands write `Host.Input` / `FrameInput` and
request a frame; `query` / `show` / `screenshot` read the last completed
frame.

Coordinates are the same space as `rect` on a record (on-screen pixels,
origin top-left).

## Commands

| Command | Reply | Effect |
|---------|--------|--------|
| `ping` | `pong` | Liveness. `drive.Start` waits on this, then 500ms for the window. |
| `move x y` | (empty) | Move the pointer; `FrameInput.Motion` is the delta from the previous point. |
| `mouse_down [button]` | (empty) | Mouse press this frame. Button: `primary` (default), `secondary`, `tertiary` (aliases `1`/`left`, `2`/`right`, `3`/`middle`). |
| `mouse_up [button]` | (empty) | Mouse release this frame. Same button names. |
| `wheel dy` | (empty) | Vertical scroll this frame. |
| `key_down Name [mods…]` | (empty) | Key down this frame: `FrameInput.Key` and add to `DownKeys`. |
| `key_up Name [mods…]` | (empty) | Key up: remove from `DownKeys`. Does not set `FrameInput.Key`. |
| `text s` | (empty) | Text this frame (as if typed / IME). `s` may be a Go-quoted string. |
| `query [q]` | `count: N` then records | N is every match; following records are those that fit. |
| `count [q]` | `N` | Number of matches this frame. Same lookup as `query`. |
| `show q` | one record or `error: no match` | First match. `q` is a name path or `#N`. |
| `focused` | `#N #M …` or empty | Identity serials: leaf, then ancestors to root. |
| `hovered` | `#N #M …` or empty | Hover stack: direct hit, then ancestors. |
| `screenshot path` | `ok` | Write a PNG of the last completed frame (`SoftRenderer`, same as `--png`). Path is the rest of the line (app filesystem). `drive.Shot` uses this when `SHIREI_DRIVE_TRACE` is set. |
| `quit` / `exit` | (empty) | `generic.ExitWithCleanup(0)` on a new goroutine. |

`query` with no matches is `count: 0`. `count` with no matches is `0`.
`show` with no match is `error: no match`. `focused` / `hovered` with
none is empty.

## Keys

Named keys (case-insensitive):

`tab`, `space`, `enter` / `return`, `escape` / `esc`, `left`, `right`,
`up`, `down`, `home`, `end`, `backspace`, `delete`, `pageup`, `pagedown`,
`f1`…`f12`.

A single letter or digit is that key (`key_down a`, `key_down A`, `key_down 3`).

Modifiers after the name, any subset:

`shift`, `alt`, `ctrl` / `control`, `cmd` / `command`, `primary`
(platform primary: Cmd on macOS, Ctrl elsewhere).

`key_down` is the down edge and holds the key in `DownKeys` until
`key_up`. A frame that saw input always requests one follow-up produce
(empty `FrameInput`, keys still held). `drive.Key` is a tap: `key_down`
(`Pause`), `Tick`, `key_up` (`Pause`). `Pause` is 150ms. `Tick` /
`Frames` sleep ~1/60s; they are not kernel commands.

---

## Query strings

`q` is space-separated names. The last token is the leaf; earlier tokens
are assigned ancestors (not necessarily immediate). Exact match.

A `q` of the form `#N` (no spaces) is an identity serial (one node or
none), not a name.

```text
query save
query toolbar save
show #12
focused
hovered
```

`query` with no argument matches every assigned node this frame, in tree
order. A virtual list only includes rows that were built.

The reply always starts with `count: N` — **N is every match**, not the
number of records that follow. Records after the blank line are as many
whole nodes as fit in the datagram. `Count > len(Nodes)` means the rest
did not fit.

```
count: 40

path: proc
rect: 1 2 3 4
value: 1
```

`drive.Query` returns `QueryResult{Count, Nodes}`. Several nodes may
share a name. Distinguish them with `value` on a record.

---

## Record format

One node per block. After `query`'s `count` line, blocks are separated
by a blank line. Fields that are false, empty, or zero are omitted
(`checked` only when true). `show` is a single record with no `count`.

```
id: #12
path: toolbar save
rect: 18 20 72 28
role: button
focused: true
```

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `id` | Identity serial (`#N`); stable while the container identity lives |
| `path` | Named-ancestor chain plus this name (empty name is `-`) |
| `rect` | `originX originY width height` (clipped, on-screen) |
| `role` | Kind, if stamped |
| `value` | Snapshot, if stamped (newlines flattened to spaces) |
| `checked` | `true` when stamped true |
| `focused` / `hovered` | This pass (`focused` is true on the leaf and every ancestor) |
| `z` | Stacking, if non-zero |
| `scroll` | `ox oy max: mx my` if this node is a scrollport |
| `caret` / `caret_h` | Only when the focused node wants keyboard this frame |
| `copy` | Clipboard text queued last frame, if this node is focused |

`focused` lists identity serials (leaf first). `hovered` lists the hover
stack. `show` / `query` records set `focused: true` when that node is on
the focus chain.

## Composed gestures

The kernel does not have `click`. A click is `show` (a tree read), then
three injects:

```text
show save
move <rect center>
mouse_down
mouse_up
```

`shirei/drive` sleeps `Pause` (150ms) after each inject so the
app can produce. Helpers take the UDP port as the first argument
(`Start` returns that port). `Timeout` (2s) is the UDP read deadline.

| Function | Sends |
|--------|--------|
| `Click(port, q)` | `show` / `move` / `mouse_down` / `mouse_up` (first match) |
| `ClickOne(port, q)` | wait until count is 1; `query`; click that record |
| `Count(port, q)` | `count` |
| `WaitCount(port, q, n)` | `count` every 100ms until n (3s) |
| `Hover(port, q)` | `show` / `move` |
| `Drag(port, from, to)` | hover `from`, `mouse_down`, hover `to`, `mouse_up` |
| `Type(port, q, s)` | `ClickOne(port, q)` then `text` per rune |
| `Key(port, name, mods…)` | `key_down` (`Pause`), `Tick`, `key_up` (`Pause`) |
| `KeyDown` / `KeyUp` | `key_down` / `key_up` |
| `Focused` / `Hovered` | `focused` / `hovered` |
| `TabUntil(port, q)` | wait until `q` is unique; Tab + `Frames(2)` + `focused` until the leaf is that record's id; wrap-around fails |
| `Tick` / `Frames(n)` | sleep n×~1/60s (no kernel command; no port) |

Raw lines: `Cmd(port, "key_down Tab")`.
